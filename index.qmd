title: "Benchmarking Cell Segmentation Methods for Xenium In Situ Data"
---

# Overview
The goal of this project is to systematically evaluate and compare computational methods for **cell segmentation** in data generated by the **10x Genomics Xenium platform**. While Xenium provides high-resolution, subcellular mapping of hundreds to thousands of RNA targets, the accurate assignment of these transcripts to individual cells is a critical challenge that significantly impacts downstream biological interpretation.
Our original data provides the location of the nuclei via DAPI staining, but not the full cell boundaries. Therefore, computational segmentation methods must infer cell boundaries based on nuclear positions and transcript distributions.

This benchmark investigates how different segmentation strategies **nuclei-centric expansions** to **transcript-aware probabilistic models**—perform across various tissue architectures, including dense, sparse, and irregularly shaped cellular environments.

# Benchmarking Metrics
To provide a comprehensive evaluation, the following metrics are utilized:

### 1. Specificity: Negative Marker Purity (NMP)
This metric quantifies the percentage of reads assigned to a cell that do *not* belong to known "negative markers" for that specific cell type, based on a matched single-cell reference. High purity (approaching 1.0) indicates the segmentation successfully excluded neighboring "contamination".


### 2. Separation Accuracy: Doublet Rate (via RCTD)
Using **Robust Cell Type Decomposition (RCTD)** in doublet mode, cells are classified as mixtures of two cell types. A high doublet rate often reveals segmentation errors or excessive tissue expansion.


### 3. Sensitivity: Median Transcripts/Genes per Cell
Tracks the efficiency of data utilization by measuring the total number of high-quality transcripts ($Q \geq 20$) and unique genes successfully assigned to each segmented mask.
