This analysis utilizes a processed single-cell RNA sequencing object
derived from the [Allen Mouse Brain
Atlas](https://alleninstitute.github.io/abc_atlas_access/notebooks/cluster_annotation_tutorial.html).

The dataset is formatted as a Seurat object containing 280504 unique
cellular samples and 32285 gene features. It includes a single RNA assay
with a counts layer. *Gene names have changed from ENSEMBL to gene
symbols*.

## Metadata

The hierarchy within the Allen ecosystem—and specifically the Allen
Brain Cell (ABC) Atlas—operates on two distinct but interconnected
planes: **cellular taxonomy** and **spatial anatomy**. This system,
defined by the [Consensus Whole Mouse Brain
Taxonomy](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06812-z), is
organized into four nested levels. At the top is the Class, a broad
category often defined by neurotransmitter type (e.g., Glutamatergic,
GABAergic, or Non-neuronal). Below this lies the Subclass, which groups
cells by major developmental or projection identities (e.g., L5 PT CTX
for Layer 5 Pyramidal Tract neurons). [The hierarchy further refines
into Supertypes and finally terminates at the Cluster
level](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/LJohnsonLab/Allen_mouse/blob/main/hierarchy.html).

## Xenium panel

With 480 genes.

After subsetting, there are 474 genes from the xenium panel in the
reference scRNA-seq data.

**Not found in the reference scRNA-seq data are the following genes:**

    [1] "Clec7a, H2az1, rs429358-ALT-228:C, rs429358-WT-228, rs7412-ALT-226:T, rs7412-WT-226"
