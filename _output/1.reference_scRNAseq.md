## Single cell reference (*Downsampled from Allen Atlas*)

This analysis utilizes a processed single-cell RNA sequencing object
derived from the [Allen Mouse Brain
Atlas](https://alleninstitute.github.io/abc_atlas_access/notebooks/cluster_annotation_tutorial.html).

Briefly, we applied a stratified sampling with constraints to balance
representation: - Sampling ratio: 1:10 (ceiling division) - Per-cluster
constraints: min 50 (*unless the original cluster had less than 50
cells*), max 100 cells

The dataset is formatted as a Seurat object containing 280504 unique
cellular samples and 32285 gene features.

- It includes a single RNA assay with a counts layer. *Gene names have
  changed from ENSEMBL to gene symbols*.
- Cells keep their full hierarchical taxonomy (class, subclass,
  supertype, cluster, neurotransmitter type)

## Metadata in the full reference dataset

The hierarchy within the Allen ecosystem—and specifically the Allen
Brain Cell (ABC) Atlas—operates on two distinct but interconnected
planes: **cellular taxonomy** and **spatial anatomy**. This system,
defined by the [Consensus Whole Mouse Brain
Taxonomy](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06812-z), is
organized into four nested levels. At the top is the Class, a broad
category often defined by neurotransmitter type (e.g., Glutamatergic,
GABAergic, or Non-neuronal). Below this lies the Subclass, which groups
cells by major developmental or projection identities (e.g., L5 PT CTX
for Layer 5 Pyramidal Tract neurons). [The hierarchy further refines
into Supertypes and finally terminates at the Cluster
level](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/LJohnsonLab/Allen_mouse/blob/main/hierarchy.html).

Hierarchical taxonomy (10 Neurotransmitters → 34 classes → 338
subclasses → 1,201 supertypes → 5,322 clusters)
